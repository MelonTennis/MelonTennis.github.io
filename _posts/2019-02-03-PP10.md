## Parallel Architecture & Programing X

~~下雪啦\\(//∇//)\！！！❄️❄️❄️感觉后面的几节没什么特别复习的必要，看看知道有这么个东西就可以了～不过为了凑个整于是出现了X篇。过完年好好刷题。~~

### Message passing model

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/mpm.png" style="zoom:75%">

* Threads operate within their own private address spaces
* Threads communicate by sending/receiving messages
  * send: specifies recipient, buffer to be transmitted, and optional message identifier
  * receive: sender, specifies buffer to store data, and optional message identifier
  * Sending messages is the only way to exchange data between threads 1 and 2

* Popular software library: MPI (message passing interface)
* Hardware need not implement system-wide loads and stores to execute message passing programs

**Network Transaction**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/networktransaction.png" style="zoom:75%">

* One-way transfer of information from a source output buffer to a destination input buffer
  * causes some action at the destination
  * occurrence is not directly visible at source

**Shared Address Space Abstraction**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/sasabstraction.png" style="zoom:75%">

* Fundamentally a two-way request/response protocol
  * writes have an acknowledgement

* Source and destination addresses are specified by source of the request
  * a degree of logical coupling and trust
* No storage logically “outside the application address space(s)”
  * may employ temporary buffers for transport
* Operations are fundamentally request-response
* Remote operation can be performed on remote memory

#### Message Passing Implementation Options

* Synchronous

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/synchronousmp.png" style="zoom:75%">

  * Send completes after matching receive and source data sent
  * Receive completes after data transfer complete from matching send
  * Data is not transferred until target address is known
    * Limits contention and buffering at the destination

* Asynchronous

  * Send completes after send buffer may be reused

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/asynchronousmp.png" style="zoom:75%">

  * Good: source does not stall waiting for the destination to receive

  * Bad: storage is required within the message layer

* Key Features of Message Passing Abstraction

  * Source knows send address, destination knows receive address (after handshake)
  * Arbitrary storage “outside the local address spaces”
    * may post many sends before any receives

  * Fundamentally a 3-phase transaction
    * includes a request / response
    * can use optimistic 1-phase in limited “safe” cases

#### Challenge

**Avoiding Input Buffer Overflow**

* Requires flow-control on the sources
* Approaches:
  * Reserve space per source
  * Refuse input when full
  * Drop packets

**Avoiding Fetch Deadlock**

* Must continue accepting messages, even when cannot source msgs
* Approaches:
  * Logically independent request/reply networks
  * Bound requests and reserve input buffer space
  * [NACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acknowledgement_(data_networks)) on input buffer full

**Big Picture**

* One-way transfer of information
* No global knowledge, nor global control
* Very large number of concurrent transactions
* Management of input buffer resources
* Latency is large enough that you are tempted to “take risks”
