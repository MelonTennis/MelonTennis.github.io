### LC174. Dungeon Game

The demons had captured the princess (**P**) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (**K**) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (*negative* integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (*0's*) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (*positive* integers).

In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.

**Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.**

For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least **7** if he follows the optimal path `RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN`.

这题题设好长哦。。。总之就是求从起点到终点呢能够保证每一步的HP值都大于0，起点的最小HP值是多少。

发现discuss的想法很好，从终点开始寻找，首先初始化最下和最右的HP值，然后每一步向左向上走到起点，每一步是能到其右下的最小值。

```java
public class Solution {
    public int calculateMinimumHP(int[][] dungeon) {
        if(dungeon == null || dungeon.length == 0 || dungeon[0].length == 0)    return 0;
        int m = dungeon.length, n = dungeon[0].length;
        int[][] hp = new int[m][n];
        hp[m-1][n-1] = Math.max(1-dungeon[m-1][n-1], 1);
        for(int i = m-2; i >= 0; i--){
            hp[i][n-1] = Math.max(hp[i+1][n-1] - dungeon[i][n-1], 1);
        }
        for(int j = n-2; j >= 0; j--){
            hp[m-1][j] = Math.max(hp[m-1][j+1] - dungeon[m-1][j], 1);
        }
        for(int i = m-2; i>= 0; i--){
            for(int j = n-2; j>= 0; j--){
                int right = Math.max(hp[i+1][j] - dungeon[i][j], 1);
                int up = Math.max(hp[i][j+1] - dungeon[i][j], 1);
                hp[i][j] = Math.min(right, up);
            }
        }
        return hp[0][0];
    }
}
```
