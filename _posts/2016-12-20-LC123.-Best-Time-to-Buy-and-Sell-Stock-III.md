### Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

#### Question

Array for  *i*th price for day i. Find the maximum profit within two transactions. Stock must be sold before buying again.

#### Analysis

Typical DP question. Using 4 vaiables to represent the revenue after selling 1st and 2nd stock and the hold on value after buying 1st and 2nd stock. 

Revenue1 = max(revenue1, hold1 + boughtPrice)

Hold1 = max(hold1, -boughtPrice) 

Revenue2 = max(revenue2, hold2 + boughtPrice)

Hold2 = max(revenue1 - boughtPrice, hold2)

#### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        // dp - buy OR not
        // the largest revnue happens when we sold all the stock
        // so we have revenue1, revenue2, hold1, hold2
        int revenue1 = 0, revenue2 = 0;
        int hold1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, hold2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int p: prices){
            revenue1 = Math.max(revenue1, hold1+p); // after we sold 1st stock
            hold1 = Math.max(-p, hold1); // after we bought 1st stock
            revenue2 = Math.max(revenue2, hold2+p); // after we sold 2nd stock
            hold2 = Math.max(revenue1-p, hold2); // after we bought 2nd stock
        } // for p
        return Math.max(revenue1, revenue2);
    }
}
```
