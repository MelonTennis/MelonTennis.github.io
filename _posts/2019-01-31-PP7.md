~~真是令人自闭的一天呀， 晚上继续复习PP玩耍。快要过年了，希望新的一年能够成为成为更好的自己吧。或许我该勇敢一些，反正也没什么好失去的不是吗。游戏机卖不出去了~~

### Interconnect Network

Interconnection Network 互联网络

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/internetwork.png" style="zoom:68%">

* Used for connecting：
  * Processor cores with other cores/memories/caches
  * Caches and caches
  * I/O devices

* Importance:
  * For system scalability
  * For system performance and energy efficiency

#### Terminology

* Network node: A network endpoint connected to a router/switch

* Network interface: Connects nodes to the network

* Switch/router: Connects a fixed number of input links to a fixed number of output links
* Link: A bundle of wires carrying a signal
* Topology 拓扑结构: How switches are connected via links
* Routing 路由: How a message gets from its source to its destination in the network
* Buffering and flow control

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/interminology.png" style="zoom:70%">

#### Properties of interconnect topology

* Routing distance: Number of links (“hops”) along a route between two nodes
* Diameter: the maximum routing distance

* Average distance: average routing distance over all valid routes

* Direct 直接 vs. Indirect 间接 networks
  * Direct network: endpoints sit “inside” the network

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/directnetwork.png" style="zoom:70%">

* Bisection bandwidth：Cut network in half, sum bandwidth of all severed links

* Blocking 阻塞 vs. Non-blocking 非阻塞
  * If connecting any pairing of nodes is possible, network is non-blocking (otherwise, it’s blocking)

一个block的例子，存在资源的竞争：

#### Interconnect topologies

**Bus interconnect**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/busnet.png" style="zoom:70%">

* Good：
  * Simple design, easy to implement coherence (via snooping)
  * Cost effective for a small number of nodes

* Bad:
  * Contention: all nodes contend for shared bus
  * Limited bandwidth: all nodes communicate over same wires(1 per time)
  * High electrical load = low frequency, high power

**Crossbar interconnect**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/crossbarnet.png" style="zoom:55%">

* Every node is connected to every other node (non-blocking, indirect)
* Good: O(1) latency and high bandwidth
* Bad:
  * Not scalable: O(N2) switches
  * High cost
  * Difficult to arbitrate at scale

**Ring**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/ringnet.png" style="zoom:65%">

* Good:
  * Simple
  * Cheap: O(N) cost

* Bad:

  * High latency: O(N)

  * Bisection bandwidth remains constant as nodes are added (scalability issue)

**Mesh**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/meshnet.png" style="zoom:60%">

* Direct network
* O(N) cost, average latency: O(sqrt(N))
* Path diversity: many ways for message to travel from one node to another

**Torus**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/torusnet.png" style="zoom:70%">

* O(N) cost, but higher cost than 2D grid
* Higher path diversity and bisection BW than mesh
* Higher complexity
* Characteristics of mesh topology are different based on whether node is near edge or middle of network

**Trees**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/treenet.png" style="zoom:65%">

~~我想起来了，这个胖树，胖。。。QAQ~~

* Planar, hierarchical topology
* Like mesh/torus, good when traffic has locality
* Latency: O(lg N)
* Use “fat trees”(higher bandwidth links near root) to alleviate root bandwidth problem
  * O(N) bisection bandwidth
  * Routing: like tree routing, but randomly choose when multiple links possible

**Multi-stage logarithmic Routing**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/omeganet.png" style="zoom:60%">

* Indirect network with multiple switches between terminals
* Cost O(N lg N), latency  O(lg N)

#### Buffering and flow control

~~我想不通我当时是怎么看不明白这课件的？失去智力吗\_(:з」∠)_ 真是脑子是好的希望我也有？~~

##### Circuit switching  电路交换 vs. packet switching 封包交换

* Circuit switching sets up a full path between sender and receiver prior to sending a message
  * Establish route (reserve links) then send all data for message
  * Higher bandwidth transmission (no per-packet link mgmt overhead)
  * Does incur overhead to set up/tear down path
  * Reserving links can result in low utilization

* Packet switching makes routing decisions per packet
  * Route each packet individually (possibly over different network links)
  * Opportunity to use link for a packet whenever link is idle
  * Overhead due to dynamic switching logic during transmission
  * No setup/tear down overhead

##### Granularity of communication

* Message
  * Unit of transfer between network clients
  * Can be transmitted using many packets

* Packet
  * Unit of transfer for network
  * Can be transmitted using multiple flits
  * Format：
    * Header: Contains routing and control information
    * Payload/body: containing the data to be sent
    * Tail: Contains control information

* Flit (flow control digit)
  * Packets broken into smaller units called “flits”
  * Flit: (“flow control digit”) a unit of flow control in the network
  * Flits become minimum granularity of routing/buffering

##### Flow control

~~都是概念我是怎么做到不会的呢ORZ。。。~~

**Circuit-switched routing**

* High-granularity resource allocation
  * Pre-allocate all resources (links across multiple switches) along entire network path for a message
* Cost
  * Needs setup phase (“probe”) to set up the path
  * Lower link utilization. Transmission of two messages cannot share same link

* Benefits
  * No contention during transmission due to preallocation, so no need for buffering
  * Arbitrary message sizes

**Store-and-forward** (packet-based routing)

* Packet copied entirely into network switch before moving to next node
* Flow control unit is an entire packet
* Requires buffering for entire packet in each router
* High per-packet latency (latency = packet transmission time on link \* network distance)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/storeandforward.png" style="zoom:65%">

**Cut-through flow control** (also packet-based)

* Switch starts forwarding data on next link as soon as packet header is received
* Result: reduced transmission latency
* If output link is blocked (cannot transmit head), transmission of tail can continue
  * Worst case: entire message is absorbed into a buffer in a switch
  * Requires switches to have buffering for entire packet, just like store-and-forward

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/cutthrough.png" style="zoom:65%">

**Wormhole flow control**

* Flit: Packets broken into smaller units called “flits”

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/flit.png" style="zoom:60%">

* Routing information only in head flit
* Body flits follows head, tail flit flows body
* If head flit blocks, rest of packet stops
* Completely pipelined transmission
  * For long messages, latency is almost entirely independent of network distance (pipeline)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/wormhole.png" style="zoom:60%">

**Virtual channel flow control**

* Multiplex multiple operations over single physical channel
* Divide switch’s input buffer into multiple buffers sharing a single physical channel
* Reduces head-of-line blocking
* Other uses:
  * Deadlock avoidance
  * Prioritization of traffic classes

~~这次的都是些概念，复杂度也很好算。我知道复习这些一点用都没有，但是还是想完成，因为该死的仪式感和整体感。马上过年了，支付宝集个福蛮有气氛，挺好。~~
