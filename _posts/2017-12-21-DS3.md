## Distributed System III

这一篇关于分布式文件系统的案例学习。

首先为什么需要DFS？

* Data sharing among multiple users
  * User mobility
* Location transparency
* Backups and centralized management

那么DFS的一些Challenges:

* Heterogeneity (异质，不同的机器)
* Scale (大量用户)
* Security (...)
* Failures
* Concurrency

相对应的设计时需要考虑到的问题:

* Caching
* Consistency
* Naming
  * Authentication and access control

  ### Classical DFSs: NFS, AFS

|                         | NFS                                      | AFS                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Assumption              | ~~没讲心情不好不想填~~                            | Client machine have disks, W/W and W/R sharing are rare (文件读写操作由相同用户在同一个机器上完成), Client machines are un-trusted |
| Design/Goals            | Stateless servers with smart clients. Portable access different OS. Low implementation cost. Small number of clients. Single administrative domain. | Global distributed file system,  LARGE numbers of clients and servers, minimize/eliminate work per client operation |
| Architecture            | Clients -Network-Servers. Use RPC to forward filesystem operation to server. | Cells correspond to adminsitrative groups, and broken into volumes(miniature file systems), Client machine has cell-server database |
| Cacheing strategy       | write-through                            | write-back                               |
| Client-Side caching     | Cache both clean and dirty file data and file attributes (30s + 60s). File attributes expire after 60s, data doesn't expire. File data is checked against modified time. Dirty data buffered until file close or 30s.(in memory cache) | Callbacks: clients register with server that they have copies. Reconstruct callbacks from client if server crashes. Revalidate crashed client content from server. |
| Advantages              | No network traffic can be done locally.  | Lower server load. Better scalability.   |
| Disadvantages           | Data consistency guarantee poor. Sensitive to network latency. | Slower.                                  |
| File Access Consistency | sometime within 30+60 seconds            | session semantics for consistency        |
| Results                 | NFS provides transparent, remote file access. Simple, portable, popular. Weak consistency semantics. Requires hefty server resources to scale. | Lower server load than NFS(read-only case commonly). May slower (disk than memory). |
| Name space construction | per-client linkage. Clients mount NFS where they want. | global name space. name space consistent across clients. |
| Location transparency   | no transparency                          | transparency                             |
| Both                    | Central server is bottleneck. All W/R hit it at least once. | A single point of failure. Costly to make fast and reliable servers. |
| User authentication     | All servers and all client workstations share the same name space. Server believes client workstation unconditionally. | Client need to authenticated themselves. |
| CAP                     | A, P                                     | A, P                                     |

* Client-side caching is a fundamental technique toimprove scalability and performance
* Timeouts and callbacks are common methods for providing (some forms of) consistency.

重要概念：**CAP**		

CAP tradeoff: 对于DFS，consistency, availability, partition-resilience不可能同时拥有。

### Modern DFSs: Coda, LBFS, etc

这节modern DFSs不算是重点，主要介绍了可以离线工作的CODA和面向低带宽网络的LBFS。CODA的重点思想是利用了Optimistic replica control和file hoarding来支持离线工作，但牺牲了Consistency。LBFS，顾名思义，在带宽低于90%传统带宽情况下也可以工作。LBFS的中心思想是将data不重叠分块，然后hash(SHA-1)每个chunk，如果data发生了改变，hash也会发生改变。这里分块的方法是Rabin fingerprint而不是按大小分块，可以尽量减少数据变更后重新hash的数据数量。另外简单介绍了Dropbox和Google两家的文件系统，有个trick是hash了数据库内容所以用户上传文件时可以避免重复上传文件，提升用户体验。顺便说一嘴，Dropbox使用AFS设计模式。

#### CODA

DFS for working in different places and without network connectivity. 

CODA大概介绍了以下几点

* Puts scalability and availability beforedata consistency
* Assumes that inconsistent updates are very infrequent => detect conflicts when reintegrating
* Introduced disconnected operation mode byallowing cached data (weakly consistent), backedby a file hoarding database
* Limitations: Detects only W/W conflicts, no R/W(lazy consistency), no client-client sharing possible

#### LBFS

LBFS大概就是以下几点内容。

* Under normal circumstances, LBFS consumes90% less bandwidth than traditional file systems.
* Makes transparent remote file access a viable andless frustrating alternative to running interactiveprograms on remote machines.
* Key Ideas: Content based chunks definition, rabinfingerprints to deal with insertions/deletions,hashes to determine content changes...
