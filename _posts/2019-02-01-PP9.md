## Parallel Architecture & Programing VIIII

~~嗯。。。马上就复习完了。感觉再次看这个课件就基本上都能看懂了，当时学的时候是有很多地方很难理解来着。可能这就是书读百遍其义自现的道理吧。当然也可能是我一紧张脑子都不转了，却还要坚持学习，好气哦:-) 看课件的时候也会想起当时，恨不得找个缝把愚蠢的自己给塞进去orz，苍天鸭。马上要过年啦，巧了么这不是，去年过年的时候我在写assign2呀，今年过年居然还是PP。(小老弟你怎么回事啊~~

### Transactional Memory

**Declarative vs. imperative abstractions**

* Declarative: programmer defines what should be done
  * Execute all these independent 1000 tasks
  * Perform this set of operations atomically

* Imperative: programmer states how it should be done
  * Spawn N worker threads. Assign work to threads by removing work from a shared task queue
  * Acquire a lock, perform operations, release the lock

**Terminology** 

* Memory transaction 事务内存
  * An atomic and isolated sequence of memory accesses
  * Inspired by database transactions

* Atomicity (all or nothing) 原子性
  * Upon transaction commit, all memory writes in transaction take effect at once
  * On transaction abort, none of the writes appear to take effect
  * Atomic { } ≠ lock() + unlock()
    * Atomic: high-level declaration of atomicity, does not specify implementation
    * Lock: low-level blocking primitive, does not provide atomicity or isolation on its own
* Isolation 隔离
  * No other processor can observe writes before transaction commits

* Serializability 可串行化
  * Transactions appear to commit in a single serial order
  * But the exact order of commits is not guaranteed by semantics of transaction

**Load-linked, store conditional (LL/SC)**

* [LL/SC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load-link/store-conditional) is a light version of transactional memory
* Pair of corresponding instructions
  * load_linked(x): load value from address
  * store_conditional(x, value): store value to x, if x hasn’t been written to since corresponding LL
* Corresponding ARM instructions: LDREX and STREX

**Advantages (promise) of transactional memory**

* Easy to use synchronization construct
  * Claim: transactions are as easy to use as coarse-grain locks
* Often performs as well as fine-grained locks
  * Provides automatic read-read concurrency and fine-grained concurrency
  * Performance portability: locking scheme for four CPUs may not be the best scheme for 64 CPUs

* Failure atomicity and recovery
  * No lost locks when a thread fails
  * Failure recovery = transaction abort + restart

* Composability
  * Safe and scalable composition of software modules

#### Implementing transactional memory

**TM implementation basics**

* TM systems must provide atomicity and isolation
  * Without sacrificing concurrency

* Basic implementation requirements
  * Data versioning (ALLOWS transaction to abort)
  * Conflict detection and resolution (WHEN to abort)

* Implementation options
  * Hardware transactional memory 
  * Software transactional memory
  * Hybrid transactional memory

##### Data versioning

* Manage uncommitted (new) and previously committed (old) versions of data for concurrent transactions.

* Eager versioning (undo-log based)

  * Update memory location directly on write
  * Maintain undo information in a log
  * Good: faster commit
  * Bad: slower aborts, fault tolerance issues

* Lazy versioning (write-buffer based)

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/lazyversioning.png" style="zoom:60%">

  * Buffer data in a write buffer until commit
  * Update actual memory location on commit
  * Good: faster abort (just clear log), no fault tolerance issues
  * Bad: slower commits

##### Conflict detection

* Must detect and handle conflicts between transactions
  * Read-write conflict: transaction A reads address X, which was written to by pending transaction B
  * Write-write conflict: transactions A and B are both pending, and both write to address X

* System must track a transaction’s read set and write set
  * Read-set: addresses read within the transaction
  * Write-set: addresses written within the transaction

* Pessimistic detection

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/pessimisticdetection.png" style="zoom:60%">

  * Check for conflicts during loads or stores
  * “Contention manager” decides to stall or abort transaction when a conflict is detected

* Optimistic detection

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/optimisticdetection.png" style="zoom:60%">

  * Detect conflicts when a transaction attempts to commit
  * On a conflict, give priority to committing transaction
  * Note: can use optimistic and pessimistic schemes together

* Trade-offs

  * Pessimistic conflict detection (a.k.a. “eager”)
    * Good: Detect conflicts early (undo less work, turn some aborts to stalls)
    * Bad: no forward progress guarantees, more aborts in some cases
    * Bad: fine-grained communication (check on each load/store)
    * Bad: detection on critical path
  * Optimistic conflict detection (a.k.a.“lazy” or “commit”)
    * Good: forward progress guarantees
    * Good: bulk communication and conflict detection
    * Bad: detects conflicts late, can still have fairness problems

* Granularity

  * Object granularity (SW-based techniques)
    * Good: reduced overhead (time/space)
    * Good: close to programmer’s reasoning
    * Bad: false sharing on large objects 
  * Machine word granularity
    * Good: minimize false sharing
    * Bad: increased overhead
  * Cache-line granularity
    * Good: compromise between object and word

##### Hardware transactional memory (HTM)

* Data versioning is implemented in caches
  * Cache the write buffer or the undo log
  * Add new cache line metadata to track transaction read set and write set

* Conflict detection through cache coherence protocol
  * Coherence lookups detect conflicts between transactions
  * Works with snooping and directory coherence
* Note: Register checkpoint must also be taken at transaction begin
