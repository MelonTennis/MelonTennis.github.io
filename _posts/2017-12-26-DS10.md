## Distributed System X

假装时差不存在并不代表时差真的不存在ORZ。这一篇关于Virualization, 介绍不同种类Virtualization异同，Container和Docker。

Virtualization: "a technique for hiding the physical characteristics of computing resources from the way in which other systems, applications, or end users interact with those resources. This includes making a **single physical resource appear to function as multiple logical resources**; or it can include making multiple physical resources appear as a single logical resource”

Motivation: virtual machine, isolation

| Physical Machine                         | Virtual Machine                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| physical hardware + software             | sofeware abstraction + virtualization layer |

| Properties:                              | fidelity, perfomance, safety and isolation |

### Types of Virtualization

**System virtualiation**: Virtualizing the entire hardware and software layers

* Type1 Naive/Bare metal
  * Higher performance
  * VMWare ESX, Xen, Hyper-V
* Type2 Hosted
  * Easier to install
  * Leverage host's device drivers
  * VMware Workstation, Parallels

**Process virtualization**: Virtualizing OS resources between processes

* Language-level: Java, .NET, Smalltalk
* OS-level : Solaris Zones, BSD Jails, Linux namespace

**Full virtualization**

* Unmodified OS, virtualization is transparent to OS
* VM looks exactly like a physical machine

**Para virtualization**

* OS modified to be virtualized
* Better performance at cost of transparency

### Requirment of Virtualization

* Isolation: fault/performance
* Encapsulation: capture all VM states/enables VM snapshots or clones
* Portability: independent of physical hardware/enables migration/easy clone
* Interposition: transformations on instructions, memory, I/O

### Implement

**Processor Virtualization**

All instructions either privileged or non-privileged

* Privileged instruction: trap
* Non-privileged instruction: execute natively
* CPU virtualization: trap-and-emulate
    * Special instructions: behaves differently depending on the CPU state
    * Solution: replace non-virtualizable instructions with easily Virtualized ones statically(Para)/perform binary translation(Full)/supports "guest" model

**Memory Virtualization**

* OS assumes that it has full control over memory
* VMM partitions memory among VMs
* Abstrations: logical/physical/machine

**Memory Management**

* VMMs tend to have simple memory management
* More sophistication: Overcommit with ballooning
* Even more sophistication: memory de-duplication

**I/O Virtualization**

* Direct access: VMs can directly access to devices
* Shared access: VMM provides an emulated device and routes I/O data to and from the device and VMs
* Overall I/O is complicated for VMMs
* Networking also complex as VMM and guests all need network access

**Storage Management**

* VMM provides both boot disk + other storage
  * Type 1 - storage guest root disks and config 
  * Type 2 - store as files in the host file system/OS
* VMM also usually provides access to network attached storage (just networking) => live migration

### Container

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YijiaJin/Plot/master/container.png" style="zoom:50%">

Motivation:

* I/O, memory, disk overhead of virtual machines
* Startup latency of virtual machines

Ideas:

* Multiple isolated instances of programs 
* Running in user-space (shared kernel)
* Instances see only resources (files, devices) assigned to their container

Requirements:

* Isolation and encapsulation
* Low overhead
* Operation System support

Key problems:

* Isolating which resources containers see 
  * each process is assigned a “namespace”
* Isolating resource usage (security & performance) 
  * usage counters for groups of processes (cgroups)
* Efficient per-container filesystems
  * layering of filesystems (copy on write)

Advantages:

* Fast boot times
* High density
* Very small I/O overhead

Limitations:

* No isolation guarantee for some resources
  * Resources that are not managed by the kernel
* Large attack surface under adversarial behavior
  * Containers typically have access to all syscalls
  * One approach: syscall filtering

| VMs                                      | Containers                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| strong isolation guarantees and security | fast startup times, negligible I/O overheads, very high density |
| OS startup, disk,memory, and hypervisor overhead | weak security isolation                  |
| isolate between different users          | isolate different applications/services of a single user |
