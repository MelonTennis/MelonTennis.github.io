### OO Python Week1

##### Object:

 Contains: Code and data

Key aspect: break problem into small understandable parts

Class/Method/Instances ~~dir()~~

> Class - a template
> Method or Message - A defined capability of a class 
> Field or attribute- A bit of data in a class
> Object or Instance - A particular instance of a class 

> “self” is a formal argument that refers to the object itself.

##### Object Lifecycle

Constructors(usually used) /Destructors(not frequently used)

> In object oriented programming, a constructor in a class is a special block of statements called when an object is created
>
> Constructors can have additional parameters

##### Inheritace

> The new class (child) has all the capabilities of the old class (parent) - and then some more -> the ability to take a class and extend it to make a new
> class

```python
class FootballFan(PartyAnimal): # inheritace
    points = 0
 def touchdown(self):
 self.points = self.points + 7
 self.party()
 print self.name,"points",self.points
```

啊~~按套路~~week1总是很简单随便介绍了介绍一些定义，正好有一些比较模糊的~~基础好差~~可以知道如何~~用英语~~描述...~~什么时候码代码~~
